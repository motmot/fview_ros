fview_ros
=========

This is an FView plugin that publishes raw images to ROS. I imagine
that this would be useful when one wants to have another FView plugin
doing realtime tracking but sometimes wants the raw images in another
ROS node. It could also be used as a template for publishing other
types of information to ROS from an FView plugin.
